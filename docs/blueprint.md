## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#CED46A) to highlight main interactive elements like buttons and headers. The choice of gold evokes feelings of prestige and leisure, and its low saturation helps to make it suitable for use on the screen.
- Background color: Dark green (#07553B) for backgrounds, menus, and main text areas. This creates a sophisticated and calming user experience and reflects the natural elements of a golf course.
- Accent color: Yellow-Green (#8CD46A). A lighter analogous color offers good visual contrast with both primary and background.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a balance of elegance and readability.
- Use a consistent set of outline icons for navigation and key features. These icons should be simple, modern, and easily recognizable to enhance usability.
- Employ a modern, responsive, and minimalistic design suitable for both mobile and desktop devices. Utilize a grid-based layout for content alignment and visual consistency.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting. For example, smooth transitions between pages and interactive feedback on button presses.
